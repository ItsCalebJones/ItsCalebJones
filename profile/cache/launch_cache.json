In addition to its military space launch mission, Vandenberg Space Force Base also hosts space launches for civil and commercial space entities, such as NASA and SpaceX.", "map_image": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/map_images/location_11_20200803142416.jpg", "timezone_name": "America/Los_Angeles", "total_launch_count": 864, "total_landing_count": 33}, "country_code": "USA", "map_image": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/map_images/pad_39_20200803143542.jpg", "total_launch_count": 98, "orbital_launch_attempt_count": 98}, "infoURLs": [], "vidURLs": [], "webcast_live": false, "timeline": [], "image": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/firefly_alpha_l_image_20240605174156.jpeg", "infographic": null, "program": [], "orbital_launch_attempt_count": 7216, "location_launch_attempt_count": 865, "pad_launch_attempt_count": 99, "agency_launch_attempt_count": 7, "orbital_launch_attempt_count_year": 43, "location_launch_attempt_count_year": 13, "pad_launch_attempt_count_year": 1, "agency_launch_attempt_count_year": 1, "pad_turnaround": "P305DT11H13M", "mission_patches": [{"id": 1302, "name": "FLTA007_patch", "priority": 10, "image_url": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/mission_patch_images/flta007_patch_mission_patch_20260204183927.png", "agency": {"id": 265, "url": "https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/265/", "name": "Firefly Aerospace", "type": "Commercial"}}], "type": "detailed"}, {"id": "cd4bb934-0652-4425-9a5c-bbe5e467ade4", "url": "https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/launch/cd4bb934-0652-4425-9a5c-bbe5e467ade4/", "slug": "kairos-flight-3", "flightclub_url": null, "r_spacex_api_id": null, "name": "KAIROS | Flight 3", "status": {"id": 1, "name": "Go for Launch", "abbrev": "Go", "description": "Current T-0 confirmed by official or reliable sources."}, "last_updated": "2026-02-27T02:08:05Z", "updates": [{"id": 14109, "profile_image": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/profile_images/cosmic2520penguin_profile_20210817212020.png", "comment": "Rescheduled for March 1st.", "info_url": "https://x.com/Kairos_SPACEONE/status/2027202289317154956", "created_by": "Cosmic_Penguin", "created_on": "2026-02-27T02:08:00Z"}, {"id": 14060, "profile_image": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/profile_images/cosmic2520penguin_profile_20210817212020.png", "comment": "Delayed into March due to launch site weather forecasts.", "info_url": "https://x.com/kairos_spaceone/status/2025342360503418970", "created_by": "Cosmic_Penguin", "created_on": "2026-02-21T23:10:00Z"}, {"id": 13330, "profile_image": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/profile_images/cosmic2520penguin_profile_20210817212020.png", "comment": "Added tentative launch window.", "info_url": "https://x.com/nvslive/status/2000451210487451689", "created_by": "Cosmic_Penguin", "created_on": "2025-12-15T06:22:00Z"}, {"id": 13233, "profile_image": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/profile_images/cosmic2520penguin_profile_20210817212020.png", "comment": "Added launch.", "info_url": "https://x.com/mainichi/status/1998719209807949975", "created_by": "Cosmic_Penguin", "created_on": "2025-12-10T13:16:00Z"}], "net": "2026-03-01T02:00:00Z", "net_precision": {"id": 1, "name": "Minute", "abbrev": "MIN", "description": "The T-0 is accurate to the minute."}, "window_end": "2026-03-01T02:20:00Z", "window_start": "2026-03-01T02:00:00Z", "probability": null, "weather_concerns": null, "holdreason": "", "failreason": "", "hashtag": null, "launch_service_provider": {"id": 1083, "url": "https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/1083/", "name": "Space One", "featured": false, "type": "Commercial", "country_code": "JPN", "abbrev": "Space One", "description": "Space One is a private launch service provider founded in 2018 by Canon Electronics, IHI Aerospace, construction company Shimizu and the government-backed Development Bank of Japan.
